# CSharp-ServerStatus
A quick and dirty C# application to check server status and disk health from a centralized web server.  

## Goals:
1. Create a fully self hosted solution, scalable to as many systems as is practical.  
2. Create a centralized logging system for status changes.
3. Alert the user when a critical system component is damaged. 


CLIENT SETUP:

**curl -L https://TBDADDRESS | bash**
